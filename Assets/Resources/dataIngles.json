                  "diet": "Its diet includes fruits, especially berries, and it also consumes insects and nectar from flowers. It has a preference for ripe fruits, which it uses to aid seed dispersal. It occasionally forages for insects in the foliage of trees.",
                  "reproduction": "Reproductive activity is typically observed between February and August. They build cup-shaped nests, often in trees or bushes, using fine plant materials. The female lays 2-3 eggs, which are incubated for about 12-14 days. Both parents participate in feeding the chicks after hatching.",
