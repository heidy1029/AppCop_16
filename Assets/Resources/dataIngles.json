This control of invertebrates is essential for maintaining the health of wetland ecosystems. Interaction with other organisms: As a predator, the Snail Kite plays a crucial role in the food chain. Its presence can influence the dynamics of other species, both as prey for birds of prey and other predators, and by controlling the populations of its prey. Ecosystem health indicator: The abundance and distribution of the Snail Kite can be indicators of the health of wetlands and freshwater bodies, as their well-being depends on a healthy aquatic ecosystem. Seed dispersal: Although its diet is predominantly carnivorous, the Snail Kite can also contribute to seed dispersal if it occasionally consumes fruits, promoting vegetation regeneration and diversity in its environment."

                        "conservation": "LC least concern",
                        "description": "It is a large nocturnal bird with big yellow eyes. It often perches on branches, fence posts, or exposed limbs where its cryptic coloration helps it avoid detection. It is more frequently identified by its eerie, descending call and is typically solitary.",
                        "mainImage": "Images/Interface/Cards/FierceFlight/POTOO",
                        "habitat": "They inhabit the rainforests of the Neotropics, living in forest edges, humid and very humid areas, and also open areas near water bodies, plantations with scattered trees, forest edges, gallery forests, and mangroves.",
                        "diet": "They feed at night by perching on exposed branches and catching flying insects. They remain upright, watching attentively with frequent head movements until they spot a large insect. The insects are caught mid-air and then the bird often returns to the same perch.",
                        "size": "It measures between 33 and 38 cm in length.",
                        "reproduction": "It is believed that the common potoo is monogamous; both sexes are said to incubate the egg and care for the chick. They lay a single egg, which is incubated on top of a broken branch or stump, or in a slight depression on a large tree limb.",
                        "funFact1": "It remains still during the day. It perches on high branches, usually in an upright posture. When not alarmed, it perches more vertically with its bill pointed forward instead of upwards.",
                        "funFact2": "When it suspects it’s being watched, it stretches its body, compresses its plumage, and raises its head, all so gradually that no movement is detected. It may use the same roosting spot for months.",

                        "bibliography": "Nyctibius griseus plays a crucial ecological role in its ecosystem. As a nocturnal insect predator, it helps control pest populations, contributing to the balance of the food chain. Additionally, by consuming insects that could harm vegetation, it indirectly protects local flora. As part of the trophic web, it also serves as prey for larger predators, making it an important component of the ecosystem's biodiversity."
